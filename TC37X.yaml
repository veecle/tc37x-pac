              **Tx Buffer Data Field Size**
              
              This bitfield is CCE and INIT protected. Writes will only have effect, if both bits are set.
              
              **Note:** In case the data length code DLC of a Tx Buffer element 
              is configured to a value higher than the Tx Buffer data field size 
              TXESC.TBDS, the bytes not defined by the Tx Buffer are transmitted 
              as “0xCC” (padding bytes).
